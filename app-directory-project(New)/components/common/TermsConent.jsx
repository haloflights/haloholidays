              <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
              On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share or bookmark the web pages. In order to implement these buttons, 
              and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside. You should be aware that these sites are likely
              to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that 
              action and may use that information. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact that you are visiting our site and the specific pages you are on,
              even if you don't click on the button if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook. You should check the respective policies of each of these
              sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.

              from collecting information on your usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not know who you are but are likely

              <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">
              When making your booking we, will arrange for you to enter into a contract with each of the third party supplier(s) of your travel arrangements 
              (such as tour operator, airline, cruise operator, accommodation provider, car hire provider and transfer provider) as specified on your booking confirmation. 
              Your contract comes into existence once we issue the booking confirmation.
                <br />
                <br />
                Your booking with us is subject to these Booking Conditions and as well as those of the third party suppliers who have their own terms and 
                conditions which govern the services they provide and you’ll be bound by these. In the event of any conflict between a supplier’s terms and 
                conditions and these booking conditions, the supplier’s term or condition that conflicts with ours will take precedence, unless it is deemed
                 under English law to be invalid or unenforceable, in which case the relevant term or condition in our Booking Conditions will prevail. Some of our 
                 suppliers’ conditions may limit or exclude their liability to you and, because they’ll apply to your contract with us, may also limit or exclude our liability to you.
                  Suppliers’ terms and conditions are often subject to international conventions too, which limit their (and our) liability. 
                Copies of the relevant supplier’s terms and conditions and any applicable international conventions are available on request.
                <br/> <br/>
                As an agent, we accept no responsibility for the acts or omissions of the suppliers or for the travel services provided by them unless we are the
                 organiser of your package holiday under the Package Travel Regulations, in which case we will accept responsibility for those travel services in accordance
                  with Section B of these Booking Conditions.

              sold or charged by us at an inclusive or total price; or advertised or sold under the term “package” or a similar term.

               will still be available at the time of booking and once you have made a booking request, we will confirm availability of your chosen travel services to you
              <br/> <br/>
              Where you book online, the order summary email sent to you is NOT contractual acceptance of the supplier’s ability to provide these travel services, 
              it is an acknowledgement that we have received your offer, and should the travel services be available as detailed on our website then we will issue 
              to you a booking confirmation which is when your contract with us comes into existence and you have entered into a legally binding agreement to
               purchase those travel arrangements subject to the supplier’s terms and conditions and these Booking Conditions
               <br/> <br/>

               in your party and that the travel itinerary accords with your requirements. Changes are rarely possible once flight tickets and other travel 
               documents are issued, and alterations may incur additional charges. See Clause 6 regarding amendment fees and cancellation charges 
               <br/> <br/>

              </h2>
              <p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt-5">

              Financial protection: When you buy an ATOL protected flight from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected,
              where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. You will be advised at the time of booking whether 
              your flight is ATOL protected and if your flight is protected you will be issued with an ATOL certificate. See Clause 8 for further details of ATOL protection.
              <br/> <br/>
              <b>Not all of our flights are ATOL protected:</b> some flight only sales are sold by us as agent for the airline. <br/>
              <b>Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance: </b>Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance (or SAFI) can be purchased at your option at an additional cost to protect your payments in the event of airline failure. 
              Please ask to see the terms of the SAFI policy for precise details of what is covered <br/> 
              <b> Availability: </b> Seat availability and pricing is at the airline’s discretion. Flight times shown are provisional and may be subject to change, as per the airline’s booking conditions. 
              Most airlines stipulate that bookings are non-refundable. <br/>
              <b>Fares:</b> Airfares can increase quickly after initial quotation and so please make payment within 1 hour of your booking having been confirmed in order to guarantee the fare offered. 
              If your fare has changed by the time you make payment, you will have a right to cancel and claim a full refund if you do not want to proceed with the booking <br/>
              <b>Indirect flights: </b>  Please note that some flights may be indirect and fly via other airports. Where an indirect flight is offered, full details of any flight 
              stopovers will be made clear to you at the time of booking <br/>
              <b>Baggage allowance: </b> The free baggage allowance offered to the passenger differs significantly from airline and airline and depending on the route. Our prices include the standard baggage allowance allowed by the airline.
               The allowance you are entitled to will be shown in the booking conditions of your airline. Some airlines may allow additional luggage to be added after the booking – this depends on the terms and conditions of the individual 
               airline to which you should refer <br/>
               Certain airlines consider hold luggage to be an optional extra. When you are booking with an airline that does make a charge for hold luggage, it is not included or displayed in our headline prices and the option to add this 
               extra facility will be offered to you at the time of booking. Should you choose not to take any hold luggage on your trip then you will receive the standard hand luggage allowance as detailed in the airlines booking conditions 
               which is normally between 5 and 10kgs but please check your booking confirmation which will specify the hand luggage allowance. Bags must be no larger than the dimensions allowed by the airline in question for carry-on luggage. 
               For further information please refer to the airline booking conditions. <br/>
               Please note many countries including the UK have importing food, plant and animal products. You should ensure that you do not carry any restricted items <br/> <br/>
               <b>Check-in:</b> Check-in procedures are included in the booking confirmation email we send to you. Some airlines will require this check-in to be carried out online; 
               where this is required, failure to check-in online will result in check-in fees at the airport which you will be liable to pay for. It is your sole responsibility 
               to follow the airline’s check-in procedures and to check-in in good time for your flight. Tickets cannot be refunded or changed because of a no show or late check-in
                at the airport. To allow adequate time for security and check-in procedures, we recommend that you arrive at the airport 3 hours before your departure time.
                 Check-in counters generally close 60 minutes prior to departure <br/> <br/>
                 <b>Amendment and cancellation:</b> Most flight bookings are non-refundable by the airline and any amendment or cancellation will incur charges. See the individual airline’s booking conditions for further details and Clause 6 below.
                  As we are your booking agent, please contact us in the event of any amendment or cancellation – see Clause 6 below

               Insurance – we will advise you where insurance is compulsory. We recommend that your insurance policy covers you, as a minimum, against the cost of 
               cancellation by you; the cost of medical assistance (including repatriation) in the event of accident or illness; loss of baggage and money; and other expense. <br/> <br/>

OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS ORGANISER FOR PACKAGES </h2>

<p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt5">

<b>Liability as organiser:</b>
Where you have booked a package where we are acting as organiser under the Package Travel Regulations, although we still act as agent for the supplier/principals of your chosen travel arrangements 
and your contracts will be with the supplier/principals, we will accept responsibility for the travel arrangements making up your package as an “organiser” under the Package Travel Regulations as set out below.
As such, we are responsible to properly provide all of the travel services included in your Package, as set out in your booking confirmation.
Subject to these Booking Conditions, if we (or the supplier/principals) have failed to perform or has improperly performed those travel arrangements and we don’t remedy or resolve your complaint within a 
reasonable period of time and this has affected the enjoyment of your Package, you may be entitled to an appropriate price reduction or compensation or both. The level of such compensation will be calculated 
taking into consideration all relevant factors such as (but not limited to): you having followed the complaints procedure as described in these Booking Conditions and the extent to which ours or our employees’ or
the supplier/principal’s negligence affected the overall enjoyment of your Package. Please note that it is your responsibility to show that we or the Supplier/Principals have failed to perform or improperly
performed your Package if you wish to make a claim against us. <br/>

We will not be responsible or pay you any compensation for any injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost or other claim of any description if (and to the extent that) it results from: <br/>

•	c. due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary circumstances (as defined in Clause 14).
Limits on liability: If we are found liable under this clause and/or the Package Travel Regulations, we will limit the amount of compensation we may have to pay you as follows: <br/>
•	a. Claims which don’t involve injury, illness or death. The maximum amount we will have to pay you in respect of these claims is up to three times the price paid by or on behalf of the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you or your party has not received any benefit at all from your booking <br/>
•	b. Claims in respect of international travel by air, sea and rail, or any stay in a hotel. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  •	i. The extent of our liability will in all cases be limited as if we were carriers under the applicable international conventions, which include The Warsaw/Montreal Convention (international travel by air); The Athens Convention (with respect to sea travel); The Berne/Cotif Convention (with respect to rail travel) and The Paris Convention (with respect to hotel accommodation). You can ask for copies of these Conventions from our offices <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  •	ii. In addition, you agree that the operating carrier or transport company's own 'Conditions of Carriage' will apply to you on that journey. When arranging transportation for you,
 we rely on the terms and conditions contained within these international conventions and those 'Conditions of Carriage'. You acknowledge that all of the terms and conditions contained in those 
 'Conditions of Carriage' form part of your Package booking with us,

PROMPT ASSISTANCE FOR PACKAGES </h2>

<p className="text-15 text-dark-1 mt5">

If you have booked a Package and whilst you are on holiday, you find yourself in difficulty for any reason we will offer you such prompt assistance as is appropriate in the circumstances.
 In particular, we will provide you with appropriate information on health services, local authorities and consular assistance, and with distance communications and finding alternative travel arrangements. 
 Where you require assistance that is not due to any failure by us, our employees or sub-contractors, we will not be liable for the costs of any alternative travel arrangements or other such assistance you require.
  Any supplier/principal, airline or other transport supplier may however pay for or provide refreshments and/or appropriate accommodation and you should make a claim directly to them. Subject to the other terms of 
  these Booking Conditions, we will not be liable for any costs, fees or charges you incur in the above circumstances, if you fail to obtain our prior authorisation before making your own travel arrangements.
   Furthermore, we reserve the right to charge you a fee for our assistance in the event that the difficulty is caused intentionally by you or a member of your party, or otherwise through you or your party’s 
   negligence. <br/> <br/>
